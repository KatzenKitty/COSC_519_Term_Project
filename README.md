## Harry Potter Interactive Photo Frame
This project uses a raspberry pi to simulate a "magic" photograph similar to those described in the Harry Potter literary universe. In Harry Potter, the photographs and portaits of people act essentially as mini instances of that person, able to interact with the outside world and even talk. For example, Harry looks at a photo of his parents when he is upset and they look sympathetic, wave, and blow him kisses to try and comfort him. We wanted to simulate this using the Raspberry Pi Zero, an HDMI display, gesture-sensing technology, and a normal photo frame. This readme describes our process and solutions to challenges we faced.

## Motivation
This is our Term Project for COSC 519: Operating Systems at Towson University. The goal of this assignment was to create something that would demonstrate the knowledge we have gained this semester about operating systems. An example of the topics we used in creating this project are as follows:
1. Process/Thread synchronization
2. Linux terminal
3. Shell scripting
4. Compiling from source
5. I/O devices
6.

## Features
What makes your project stand out?

## Code Example
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Installation
Provide step by step series of examples and explanations about how to get a development env running.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests
Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## How to use?
If people like your project they’ll want to learn how they can use it. To do so include step by step guide to use your project.

## Contribute

Let people know how they can contribute into your project. A [contributing guideline](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-electron/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) will be a big plus.
